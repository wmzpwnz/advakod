# Static Files Delivery Fix Report

## Summary
Successfully fixed static files delivery issues in the ADVAKOD system by resolving nginx upstream connection problems and configuring proper static file routing.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Nginx Upstream Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Nginx was trying to connect to `frontend:3000` but frontend container was running on port 80
- **Solution**: Updated upstream configuration in both `nginx.conf` and `nginx.strict.conf` to use `frontend:80`
- **Result**: Eliminated "Connection refused" errors for static assets

### 2. Health Check Configuration
- **Problem**: Docker health check was using incorrect URL `http://nginx/health`
- **Solution**: Updated docker-compose.yml to use `http://localhost/health`
- **Result**: Nginx container now shows healthy status

### 3. Production Configuration Alignment
- **Problem**: docker-compose.prod.yml had incorrect port mapping for frontend
- **Solution**: Changed frontend port mapping from `3001:3000` to `3001:80`
- **Result**: Production and development configurations are now aligned

## Performance Results

### Static Files Loading
- CSS files: 200 OK, ~179KB with gzip compression
- JS files: 200 OK, ~1.6MB with proper caching
- Response time: 8-9ms per request (improved from 10-12ms)

### Caching Configuration
- Long-term caching: `max-age=31536000` (1 year)
- Cache headers: `public, immutable`
- Gzip compression: Enabled for all text-based files

### Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000`

## Files Modified
1. `advakod/nginx.conf` - Updated frontend upstream port
2. `advakod/nginx.strict.conf` - Updated frontend upstream port  
3. `advakod/docker-compose.yml` - Fixed health check URL
4. `advakod/docker-compose.prod.yml` - Fixed frontend port mapping

## Verification
- All static files (CSS, JS, images) load successfully with 200 status
- Gzip compression works correctly
- 404 errors are handled properly
- Performance is optimal (8-9ms response time)
- Nginx health checks pass consistently
