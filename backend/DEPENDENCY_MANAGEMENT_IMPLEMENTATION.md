# Service Dependencies Management Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Task 9: "Implement Service Dependencies Management" which includes proper service initialization order and retry mechanisms for external services.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Dependency Manager (`app/core/dependency_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Manages external dependencies and ensures proper initialization order.

**Key Features**:
- **Dependency Registration**: Automatically registers standard dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis, ChromaDB, AI model files, embeddings)
- **Topological Sorting**: Calculates proper initialization order based on dependencies
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of dependency status with configurable intervals
- **Dependency Checking**: Validates that all dependencies are ready before service startup
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts for dependency checks

**Registered Dependencies**:
- `postgresql` - Database connection (required)
- `redis` - Cache service (optional, has fallback)
- `chromadb` - Vector store (required)
- `ai_model_file` - AI model file presence (required)
- `embeddings_model` - Embeddings model (required)

**Usage**:
```python
from app.core.dependency_manager import dependency_manager

# Check all dependencies
results = await dependency_manager.check_all_dependencies()

# Wait for required dependencies
ready = await dependency_manager.wait_for_dependencies(required_only=True, timeout=120)

# Get dependency status
status = dependency_manager.get_dependency_status()
```

### 2. Retry Manager (`app/core/retry_manager.py`)

**Purpose**: Provides robust retry mechanisms for external service connections.

**Key Features**:
- **Multiple Retry Strategies**: 
  - Fixed delay
  - Exponential backoff
  - Linear backoff
  - Random jitter
  - Fibonacci sequence
- **Service-Specific Configurations**: Pre-configured retry policies for different service types
- **Statistics Tracking**: Comprehensive retry statistics and success rates
- **Flexible Conditions**: Retry on exceptions, false results, or custom conditions
- **Decorators**: Easy-to-use decorators for adding retry logic

**Pre-configured Service Types**:
- `database` - 5 attempts, exponential backoff, 0.5s base delay
- `redis` - 3 attempts, exponential backoff, 0.2s base delay
- `chromadb` - 3 attempts, linear backoff, 1.0s base delay
- `ai_model` - 2 attempts, fixed delay, 2.0s base delay
- `file_system` - 3 attempts, fixed delay, 0.1s base delay
- `network` - 4 attempts, random jitter, 1.0s base delay

**Usage**:
```python
from app.core.retry_manager import with_database_retry, with_redis_retry

@with_database_retry(service_name="user_creation", max_attempts=5)
async def create_user(user_data):
    # Database operation with automatic retry
    pass

@with_redis_retry(service_name="cache_operation")
async def cache_data(key, value):
    # Redis operation with automatic retry
    pass
```

### 3. Integration with Main Application

**Modified Files**:
- `main.py` - Integrated dependency checking and retry mechanisms into startup
- `app/core/cache.py` - Updated Redis initialization to use retry manager
- `app/core/database.py` - Added retry logic for database initialization
- `app/services/service_manager.py` - Integrated with dependency manager

**New Health Check Endpoints**:
- `/health/dependencies` - Shows status of all system dependencies
- `/health/retry-stats` - Displays retry statistics for all services

## Implementation Details

### Service Initialization Order

The system now follows this initialization sequence:

1. **Dependency Check Phase** (120s timeout):
   - Check PostgreSQL connection
   - Check Redis availability (optional)
   - Verify ChromaDB readiness
   - Validate AI model file presence
   - Confirm embeddings model availability

2. **Service Initialization Phase**:
   - Database initialization with retry (5 attempts)
   - Cache service initialization with retry (3 attempts)
   - AI services initialization (existing logic)
   - Background monitoring startup

3. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Dependency health monitoring (30-60s intervals)
   - Automatic retry statistics collection
   - Service recovery attempts

### Retry Mechanisms

**Database Operations**:
- 5 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Base delay: 0.5s, max delay: 30s
- Retries on: ConnectionError, TimeoutError

**Redis Operations**:
- 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Base delay: 0.2s, max delay: 10s
- Automatic fallback to in-memory cache

**ChromaDB Operations**:
- 3 retry attempts with linear backoff
- Base delay: 1.0s, max delay: 15s
- Retries on: ConnectionError, RuntimeError

### Error Handling

**Informative Error Messages**:
- Detailed dependency status in health checks
- Specific error messages for each dependency type
- Retry statistics for troubleshooting
- Recommendations based on failure patterns

**Graceful Degradation**:
- System continues startup even if optional dependencies fail
- Clear logging of which dependencies are unavailable
- Fallback mechanisms where possible (e.g., in-memory cache for Redis)

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**: Automatic retry mechanisms reduce transient failure impact
2. **Better Diagnostics**: Comprehensive health checks and statistics for troubleshooting
3. **Proper Initialization**: Dependencies are checked before services start
4. **Monitoring**: Continuous dependency monitoring with automatic recovery
5. **Flexibility**: Configurable retry policies for different service types
6. **Observability**: Detailed metrics and health endpoints for system monitoring

## Configuration

### Dependency Manager Settings

```python
# Default settings (can be overridden in settings)
SERVICE_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL = 30  # seconds
SERVICE_MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS = 3
SERVICE_RESTART_DELAY = 5  # seconds
```

### Retry Manager Settings

```python
# Example custom retry configuration
from app.core.retry_manager import RetryConfig, RetryStrategy

custom_config = RetryConfig(
    max_attempts=5,
    strategy=RetryStrategy.EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF,
    base_delay=1.0,
    max_delay=60.0,
    retry_on_exceptions=[ConnectionError, TimeoutError]
)
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Check Endpoints

1. **`/health/dependencies`** - Overall dependency status
2. **`/health/retry-stats`** - Retry statistics and success rates
3. **`/ready`** - Enhanced readiness check including dependencies

### Metrics Available

- Dependency availability status
- Retry attempt counts and success rates
- Average retry times
- Last success/failure timestamps
- Service initialization times
